# theslipbarschema.sql
This is the database schema. The locations table is directly associated with the restaurants table through the foreign key restaurant_id. This allows you to have multiple locations for a single restaurant.

The events table is associated with the specific location where the event is taking place, using the foreign key location_id. This way, events are linked to a specific location, which, in turn, is associated with a particular restaurant.

This structure allows you to have a restaurant with multiple locations, and events are associated with those specific locations. You can further customize the schema based on your specific needs and business requirements.
