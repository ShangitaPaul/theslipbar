The Slip Bar &amp; Eatery website

Capstone Project Proposal:

For my capstone project, I am going to integrate with a website commission for a client. The client is The Slip Bar and Eatery; a sports bar with two locations in Redondo Beach, CA and Lomita, CA. I have already been working as their social media assistant for their Instagram page. The website should be very basic; the homepage should simply contain two links for each location, which will have their separate menus for Food, Drinks, and Specials (ie; Breakfast Burritos Saturday/Sunday, Chilli Mondays, Taco Tuesday, Pizza Thursdays). Since there is a rush to build the page, all the menus will be in PDF and in a single page (no subpages). The main homepage will contain a navigation bar consisting of the following pages: About, Live Music, Merchandise (swag), Jobs, The Live Music page will contain the API for Tockify; a popular calendar app used by many restaurants. 

The website needs to be easy to maintain and update for future integrations, such as online ordering and pickup and delivery via Doordash or UberEats. The PDF menus will eventually be replaced by the interactive third-party menu provider, Toast.

# Steps

Below is a simplified guide to create this webpage:

Define Requirements: Identify the features and content you want on the website. Decide on the technologies and programming languages you'll use.

Set Up Development Environment: Install a local development server (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP) if you're developing locally. Set up a version control system via Github

Choose a Web Development Stack: Select a backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails). Choose a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js). Decide on a database (e.g., MySQL).

Design Database Schema: Create a database schema to store restaurant information, locations, and live music events.

Develop Backend: Implement backend APIs to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for restaurant data and live music events. Integrate the Tockify API to fetch and display live music events.

Develop Frontend: Create frontend pages for each restaurant location, displaying relevant information. Implement a Live Music calendar page using Tockify's API. Use a responsive design for a better user experience across different devices.

Implement User Authentication: If necessary, implement user authentication to manage admin access for updating restaurant information.

Connect Backend and Frontend: Connect the frontend to the backend APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.

Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that all features work as expected. Test responsiveness and compatibility with various browsers.

Deployment: Choose a hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Netlify) for deployment. Set up the production environment and deploy your website.

Domain and SSL: Purchase a domain name for your restaurant. Implement SSL to ensure secure communication between users and your website.

Documentation: Document your code and provide instructions for future maintenance.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Implement monitoring tools to keep track of website performance. Schedule regular maintenance to update dependencies and ensure security.
