The Slip Bar &amp; Eatery website

Capstone Project Proposal:

For my capstone project, I am going to integrate with a website commission for a client. The client is The Slip Bar and Eatery; a sports bar with two locations in Redondo Beach, CA and Lomita, CA. I have already been working as their social media assistant for their Instagram page. The website should be very basic; the homepage should simply contain two links for each location, which will have their separate menus for Food, Drinks, and Specials (ie; Taco Tuesday, Pizza Monday, etc).. Since there is a rush to build the page, all the menus will be in PDF and in a single page (no subpages). The main homepage will contain a navigation bar consisting of the following pages: About, Live Music, Merchandise (swag), Jobs, The Live Music page will contain the API for Tockify; a popular calendar app used by many restaurants. 

The website needs to be easy to maintain and update for future integrations, such as online ordering and pickup and delivery via Doordash or UberEats. The PDF menus will eventually be replaced by the interactive third-party menu provider, Toast.
