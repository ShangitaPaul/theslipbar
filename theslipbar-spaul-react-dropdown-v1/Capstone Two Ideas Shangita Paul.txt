Project Background::
For my capstone project, I am going to integrate with a website commission for a client. The client is The Slip Bar and Eatery; a sports bar with two locations in Redondo Beach, CA and Lomita, CA. I have already been working as their social media assistant for their Instagram page. The website should be very basic; the homepage should simply contain two links for each location, which will have their separate menus. Since there is a rush to build the page, all the menus will be in PDF/images. The main homepage will contain a navigation bar consisting of the following pages: About, Locations, Jobs, Contact, and Events. The Live Music page will contain the embed API for Tockify; a popular calendar app used by many restaurants.

Project Proposal: Refactoring Restaurant Website with React, Node.js, and Google Maps API.


By refactoring the codebase and integrating new technologies, the goal is to deliver a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing web application that provides an improved user experience and facilitates navigation to the restaurant locations.


Capstone Overview:
The aim of this capstone project is to refactor an existing restaurant website draft, which is currently built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, into a modern web application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. I will then Integrate the Google Maps API to display maps and provide directions to the restaurant locations.
